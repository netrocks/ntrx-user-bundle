NtrxUserBundle
================

The NtrxUserBundle was created to close the gap the FOSUserBundle has left.
It is an implementation of an user-management-system and includes tasks like the registration or the password recovery. The bundle is as slim and flexible as possible.

Reporting an issue or a feature request
---------------------------------------

Issues and feature requests are tracked in the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/issues).

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project
built using the [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard)
to allow developers of the bundle to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it
and following some steps.
